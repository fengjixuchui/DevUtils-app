# Overview

<b>DevUtils</b> helps you with your tiny daily tasks with just a single click! It's totally open source and work offline. You can buy the pre-built app by visiting the website https://devutils.app or you can build the app from source by yourself!

# A friendly note from author
DevUtils is a **paid open source** app. That means I'm selling the [pre-built version of the app](https://devutils.app) to earn some revenue for my time. I'm glad that you like the app and you are free to build it for your own use. I trust that you will not redistribute the app in any other means. Thank you very much! :)

# Source code
Development environment:
- Swift 5.1+
- Xcode 11.1+
- Swift Package Manager
- Carthage

# Build Instructions
 - Clone repository.
 - Bootstrap carthage, this will install the required dependencies for the app:
 
     `carthage bootstrap --platform macOS`
 
 - Update signing Team to be your Personal or organizational Team in Xcode. This is needed to build the app locally. As the signing step could be different between Xcode versions, I may not be able to support you on this (help wanted, feel free to open a PR to update this instruction).
